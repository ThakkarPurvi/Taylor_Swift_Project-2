**The Story of Us** – **Taylor Swift Mix**

- The app that generates a Taylor Swift Playlist that perfectly sums up your last relationship. 
- Aim and Objective of the Project:   

Time and generations have changed immensely. Before 1990, we bought cassettes to listen to music. From 1995-to 2000, we downloaded songs from the internet to listen to music. 

In the 2010s, we started using the applications to listen to music. According to Goldman Sachs, the music industry will increase from $62 billion in 2017 to $131 billion in 2030. This clearly explains we have little time to pick the right song/singer we want to hear in the right mood at the right time from the 100 million songs worldwide.  

Taylor Swift is one of the most popular artists of all time, in part due to her huge discography of famously relatable songs written about different sorts of relationships. You can create a perfect playlist for any relationship, past or present, based on only Taylor Swift songs.  

We at Taylor Swift Mix have developed an application that will take users' input to create a playlist that perfectly sums up their feelings about a past or current relationship, using Spotify API. Our listeners and creators want to deliver innovation to create the best user experience possible.
